# Cash Cruiser
By: Bryson Lee-Kwen


## What is Cash Cruiser?
A scroller game where the player controls a rocket ship that must transport $20 throughout space for 60 seconds. Along the way are gates that can either decrease or increase the rocket's money. As long as the rocket's value does not go below $0 the player wins.


## How to Play.
To get started just hit [1] on the keyboard. There is a tutorial (hit [2] to access) but the game is pretty simple. Just use the arrow keys (or a/d) to go left and right to navigate your way through the gates. The game gets harder at the end and not every run will result in a win.

## How to win.
Keep your value above $0 the whole time. Once the timer hits zero, the player wins with their rockets money.
